# ElectraNed

## What is ElectraNed?
Welcome to my project that I made for the 'Tech Track' of the minor Information Design. ElectraNed is a short datavisualisation that shows how the electrification of vehicles is currently looking in the Netherlands, and why this is happening.

## How can I get it?

**WARNING: It will take quite a long time for the page to load, due to the usage of a large API, it is not broken!**

For ease of use, [my site](https://tech-track-dataviz-25-26-mats.vercel.app/) is availible thanks to Vercel.

If you want to run it on a localhost, there are a few steps you would need to complete.
(Before you can run the site locally, make sure you have:

	•	Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
	•	npm (comes with Node)
	•	(Optional) A code editor like VS Code)

**WARNING: If you choose to run it through localhost, it will take quite a long time for the page to load, due to the usage of a large API**

1. Download the `project` folder from this GitHub page.
2. Open a Command Line Interface (Terminal).
3. In your terminal, navigate to your download folder by typing `cd Downloads` (this will Change Directories to downloads).
4. Navigate to the `project` folder using `cd project` (this will Change Directories to project).
5. Type `npm install` which will install all the necessary npm dependencies.
6. type `npm run dev -- --open` to start running the site, and automatically open a webpage. You should also see a message in your terminal displaying that the site is running.
7. The site should have opened in your standard browser. If it didn't, open your prefered browser and navigate to the address `localhost:XXXX` (XXXX is a four digit number that should be visible in your terminal).

Now the site should be visible and you are ready to use it!
